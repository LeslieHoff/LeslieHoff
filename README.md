## Hi there 👋

<!-## 👋 Hi there! I'm [Leslie Hoff]

I'm a **self-motivated and meticulous data analyst** with a background in operations and bakery management. After years of running high-performing teams and streamlining business workflows, I transitioned into tech to apply my problem-solving skills to data. I recently completed the TripleTen Data Analyst Bootcamp, where I worked on projects involving real-world datasets and developed a strong foundation in data analytics.

### 🧠 Fun Facts
- I used to manage artisan bakeries and still love baking sourdough bread from scratch.
- I enjoy turning messy datasets into clean, compelling stories.
- I'm a big fan of data visualization — I think a great chart can say more than a thousand rows.

### 🤝 Open to Collaboration
I'm actively looking to participate in **outsourcing projects** or freelance work where I can contribute my data skills and continue learning. If you're working on something interesting, let's connect!

### 🛠️ Primary Tech Skills
- **Languages & Tools**: Python, SQL, Excel, Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly  
- **Visualization & BI**: Tableau, Power BI
